# Amazing Numbers
Another Project with Jetbrains

In this project I made a program to check certain numbers for various properties, with the option to stipulate multiple properties or exclude certain properties.

I thought one day when I know how to program graphs, it would be nice to modify this program to graph the counting functions and density functions of these various properties or between multiple properties. I think it would also be cool to study points i.e. sets of numbers (x, y, z, ...) of whatever dimension and try to graph their density functions. 

Maybe there is a sensible analogy to a prime number with a prime point of n dimensions, maybe sensible means that they have the similar density functions approx 1 / ln(x). Most of this is just a message to my future self to try and play around with, but thanks for checking this out if you happen not to be my future self :)
